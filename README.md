# Course Project Deliverables:
* Proposal (10%) (2 pages max) (Due on Feb. 7th 11:59pm): Define the input-output behavior of
the system and the scope of the project. What is your evaluation metric for success? Collect
some preliminary data. Note that you can still adjust your project topic within one week after
submitting the proposal.
* Final report (60%) (10-20 pages) (Due on March. 30th 11:59pm): You should have completed
everything (task definition, infrastructure, approach, literature review, coding, and error
analysis). A readme file explain in a step by step how to execute your code with full commands.
You need to use Python.
* Presenting the subject to the class on March 30th, 2021 during the class and tutorial times (more
than one session).

# Course Project Evaluation:
* Task definition: is the task precisely defined and is the motivation clear? does the world
somehow become a better place if your project were successful?
* Approach: did you describe the used methods clearly, with good justification, and testing?
* Data and experiments: have you explained the data clearly, performed systematic experiments,
and reported concrete results?
* Analysis: did you interpret the results and try to explain why things worked (or didn't work) the
way they did? Do you show concrete examples?
* Extra credit: does the project present interesting and novel ideas (i.e., would this be publishable
at a good conference)?
